# STM32-BootLoader

Initial repo for creating a portable, reliable and efficient boot-loader for STM32 ARM based micro-controllers.

## What is boot-loader?

A boot-loader is an application whose primary purpose is to allow a systems software to be updated without the use of specialized hardware such as a JTAG programmer.
